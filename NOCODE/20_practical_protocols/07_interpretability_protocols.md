## Introduction to Interpretability Protocols

Interpretability protocols transform the often opaque nature of AI interactions into transparent, understandable processes. By establishing explicit frameworks for explanation, reasoning visibility, and decision transparency, these protocols help you navigate the critical boundary between powerful capabilities and trustworthy understanding.

This guide provides ready-to-use interpretability protocols for creating transparent AI interactions, along with implementation guidance and performance metrics. Each protocol follows our NOCODE principles: Navigate, Orchestrate, Control, Optimize, Deploy, and Evolve.

## How to Use This Guide

1. **Select a protocol** that matches your transparency goal
2. **Copy the protocol template** including the prompt and customize
3. **Provide the complete protocol** to your AI assistant at the beginning of your interaction
4. **Follow the structured process** for transparent understanding
5. **Monitor metrics** to evaluate interpretability effectiveness
6. **Iterate and refine** your protocol for future interactions

**Socratic Question**: In what contexts do you find AI systems most opaque or difficult to understand? When does the "black box" nature of AI create the most significant challenges for you?

### Implementation Guide

1. **Domain Specification**:
   - Clearly define application area
   - Note specific subject matter
   - Consider stakes and risk factors

2. **Confidence Dimension Selection**:
   - Identify key aspects requiring calibration
   - Prioritize based on decision importance
   - Consider both absolute and relative confidence

3. **Calibration Purpose Clarification**:
   - Define specific goals for confidence transparency
   - Note stakeholder needs and expectations
   - Consider trust and reliability requirements

4. **Risk Context Description**:
   - Specify stakes and potential consequences
   - Note appropriate caution level
   - Consider domain-specific risk factors

### Performance Metrics

| Metric | Description | Target |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Calibration Accuracy | Alignment between expressed and actual confidence | High correlation between confidence and correctness |
| Uncertainty Transparency | Clarity about knowledge limitations | Explicit identification of uncertain areas |
| Guidance Specificity | Clarity of verification recommendations | Actionable oversight suggestions based on confidence |
| Appropriate Caution | Risk-appropriate confidence expression | Conservatism in high-stakes contexts |

## 6. The Knowledge Representation Protocol

**When to use this protocol:**
Need to understand how AI systems represent and organize information? This protocol guides you through knowledge structure transparency—perfect for mental model understanding, knowledge organization insight, concept relationship mapping, or information architecture transparency.

```
Prompt: I'm working with an AI system to develop an educational curriculum on climate science, and I need to understand how the system organizes and represents knowledge in this domain. I want visibility into conceptual relationships, information hierarchies, and knowledge structures so I can ensure the curriculum has appropriate progression and coherence. This transparency will help me create more effective educational materials.
