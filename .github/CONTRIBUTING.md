# Contributing to Context Engineering

> *"Context engineering is the delicate art and science of filling the context window with just the right information for the next step."* — Andrej Karpathy

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Context Engineering repository! This document outlines the process and guidelines for contributing to this project, which aims to operationalize the latest research on context with first principles and visuals.

##  Core Philosophy

Our approach to context engineering follows a biological metaphor of increasing complexity:

```
atoms → molecules → cells → organs → neural systems → neural fields
  │        │         │         │             │              │
single    few-     memory/    multi-    cognitive tools + context = fields +
prompt    shot      agents    agents     prompt programs   persistence & resonance
```

All contributions should align with our implementation strategy:

1. **Layered Approach**: Build from foundational concepts to advanced integration
2. **Practical Focus**: Ensure all theory has corresponding practical implementation
3. **Modular Design**: Create composable components that can be recombined
4. **Progressive Complexity**: Start simple, add sophistication incrementally
5. **Integration Emphasis**: Focus on how components work together, not just individually
6. **Self-Improvement**: Build systems that can enhance themselves
7. **Transparency**: Ensure operations remain understandable despite complexity
8. **Collaboration**: Design for effective human-AI partnership
9. **Modal Flexibility**: Support unified understanding across different modalities
