# Attractor Co-Emergence Protocol Digest

## Purpose

The `attractor.co.emerge.shell` protocol facilitates the interaction between multiple attractors in a semantic field, enabling them to co-emerge and create new semantic structures beyond what each attractor could represent individually.

## Key Concepts

- **Co-Emergence**: When multiple elements interact to create patterns and properties that none of the elements possessed individually.
- **Attractor**: A stable semantic pattern in a field that represents a coherent concept or meaning.
- **Symbolic Residue**: Fragments of meaning that might contribute to new attractors or connections.
- **Boundary Collapse**: The dissolution of boundaries between semantic regions to allow interaction.

## When to Use

Use this protocol when:

- You have multiple distinct concepts that might yield novel insights when combined
- You want to explore potential connections between different domains
- You need to resolve conflicts between competing interpretations
- You're seeking creative combinations of existing ideas

## Protocol Structure

```
attractor.co.emerge {
  intent: "Strategically scaffold co-emergence of multiple attractors",
  
  input: {
    current_field_state: <field_state>,
    surfaced_residues: <residues>,
    candidate_attractors: ["<attractor_list>"],
    explicit_protocols: "<protocols>",
    historical_audit_log: "<audit_log>",
    emergent_signals: "<signals>"
  },
  
  process: [
    "/attractor.scan{detect='attractors', filter_by='strength'}",
    "/residue.surface{mode='recursive', integrate_residue=true}",
    "/co.emergence.algorithms{strategy='harmonic integration'}",
    "/field.audit{surface_new='attractor_basins'}",
    "/agency.self-prompt{trigger_condition='cycle interval'}",
    "/integration.protocol{integrate='co_emergent_attractors'}",
    "/boundary.collapse{auto_collapse='field_boundaries'}"
  ],
  
  output: {
    updated_field_state: "<new_state>",
    co_emergent_attractors: "<attractor_list>",
    resonance_metrics: "<metrics>",
    residue_summary: "<residue_summary>",
    next_self_prompt: "<auto_generated>"
  }
}
```

## Process Steps

1. **Scan for Attractors**: Identify existing attractors in the field based on their strength.
2. **Surface Residue**: Detect symbolic fragments that might contribute to co-emergence.
3. **Apply Co-Emergence Algorithms**: Facilitate interaction between attractors using harmonic integration.
4. **Audit Field**: Identify new attractor basins that may have formed.
5. **Generate Self-Prompts**: Create prompts for the next cycle of processing.
6. **Integrate Co-Emergent Attractors**: Incorporate new attractors into the field.
7. **Collapse Boundaries**: Remove barriers between attractors to allow full integration.

## Co-Emergence Patterns

Three primary patterns of co-emergence:

1. **Complementary Co-Emergence**: Attractors complement each other, creating a more complete whole.
2. **Transformative Co-Emergence**: Attractors transform each other, creating something qualitatively different.
3. **Catalytic Co-Emergence**: One attractor catalyzes changes in another without being transformed itself.

## Implementation Example

```python
# Simple implementation example
def apply_co_emergence(concepts):
    # Create field with attractors for each concept
    field = create_field()
    attractors = [create_attractor(field, concept) for concept in concepts]
    
    # Execute co-emergence protocol
    input_data = {
        "current_field_state": field,
        "candidate_attractors": attractors
    }
    
    result = execute_protocol("attractor.co.emerge", input_data)
    
    # Extract co-emergent concepts
    co_emergent_concepts = extract_concepts(result["co_emergent_attractors"])
    
    return co_emergent_concepts
```

## Integration with Other Protocols

Works well with:

- `recursive.emergence.shell`: Add self-evolution to co-emergent attractors
- `recursive.memory.attractor.shell`: Persist co-emergent insights across sessions
- `field.resonance.scaffold.shell`: Enhance resonance between co-emergent patterns

## Practical Applications

- **Creative Ideation**: Combining concepts from different domains to generate novel ideas
- **Conflict Resolution**: Finding synthesis between competing perspectives
- **Research Integration**: Connecting findings from different research areas
- **Interdisciplinary Work**: Bridging concepts across disciplines
