# Protocol Digests

_Simplified explanations of field protocols for quick reference_

## Overview

Protocol digests provide condensed, accessible explanations of field protocols for those who need a quick understanding without diving into the full technical details. Each digest summarizes a protocol's purpose, structure, and application in a concise format.

## Purpose of Digests

Protocol digests serve several key purposes:

1. **Quick Reference**: Provide essential information at a glance
2. **Onboarding**: Help newcomers understand protocols without overwhelming them
3. **Decision Support**: Aid in selecting the appropriate protocol for a specific need
4. **Implementation Guidance**: Offer practical examples and integration patterns
5. **Cross-Protocol Comparison**: Enable easy comparison between different protocols

## Digest Structure

Each protocol digest follows a consistent structure:

```
# Protocol Name Digest

## Purpose
Clear statement of what the protocol does

## Key Concepts
Definitions of important terms and concepts

## When to Use
Guidelines for when this protocol is appropriate

## Protocol Structure
Simplified view of the protocol shell

## Process Steps
Plain-language explanation of each step

## [Protocol-Specific Section]
Information unique to this protocol

## Implementation Example
Simple code example showing basic usage

## Integration with Other Protocols
How this protocol works with others

## Practical Applications
Real-world use cases

## See Also

## Using Digests

### For Learning

Start with digests when first learning about field protocols:

1. Read the **Purpose** and **Key Concepts** sections to understand the fundamentals
2. Review the **When to Use** section to understand appropriate applications
3. Examine the **Protocol Structure** to get a high-level view of components
4. Study the **Process Steps** to understand the operational flow
5. Look at the **Implementation Example** to see practical usage

### For Implementation

Use digests as quick references during implementation:

1. Refer to the **Protocol Structure** for input/output requirements
2. Follow the **Process Steps** to ensure correct implementation
3. Adapt the **Implementation Example** to your specific needs
4. Check **Integration with Other Protocols** for combining protocols

### For Selection

Use digests to select the appropriate protocol for your needs:

1. Compare the **Purpose** sections across different protocols
2. Review the **When to Use** guidelines for each protocol
3. Consider the **Practical Applications** to find the best match
4. Check **Integration with Other Protocols** for potential combinations

## Contributing

To contribute a new protocol digest:

1. Create a markdown file named `[protocol_name].digest.md`
2. Follow the standard digest structure outlined above
3. Keep explanations concise and accessible to newcomers
4. Include practical examples that demonstrate key concepts
5. Add links to related documentation
6. Submit a pull request to the repository
