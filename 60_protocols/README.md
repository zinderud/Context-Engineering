_Structured frameworks for recursive field emergence and attractor dynamics_

## Overview

The `60_protocols` directory contains structured definitions of field protocols, shells, and frameworks for advanced context engineering, modeling context as dynamic semantic fields. These protocols represent the evolution of context engineering from discrete token-based approaches to continuous field-based approaches with emergent properties.

Field protocols provide:

1. **Structured Operations**: Clear, repeatable operations on semantic fields
2. **Recursive Frameworks**: Self-evolving patterns that improve over time
3. **Emergence Management**: Tools for facilitating and guiding emergent properties
4. **Integration Mechanisms**: Ways to combine different protocol approaches

## Protocol Shell Format

All protocol shells follow the Pareto-lang format, a concise and expressive syntax for defining field operations. The basic structure is:

```
/protocol_name {
  intent: "Clear statement of protocol purpose",
  
  input: {
    input_field_1: <type>,
    input_field_2: <type>,
    ...
  },
  
  process: [
    "/operation.name{param='value'}",
    "/operation.name{param='value'}",
    ...
  ],
  
  output: {
    output_field_1: <type>,
    output_field_2: <type>,
    ...
  },
  
  meta: {
    version: "x.y.z",
    timestamp: "<now>"
  }
}
```

## Protocol Operations

Field protocols use a set of standardized operations. Common operation namespaces include:

### Attractor Operations
- `/attractor.scan`: Identify attractors in a field
- `/attractor.strengthen`: Increase attractor strength
- `/attractor.create`: Generate new attractors
- `/attractor.merge`: Combine attractors
- `/attractor.project`: Predict attractor evolution

### Residue Operations
- `/residue.surface`: Detect symbolic residue
- `/residue.compress`: Compress residue patterns
- `/residue.integrate`: Integrate residue into field
- `/residue.echo`: Create resonant echoes of residue

### Boundary Operations
- `/boundary.collapse`: Remove or weaken boundaries
- `/boundary.adapt`: Modify boundary properties
- `/boundary.tune`: Fine-tune boundary parameters
- `/boundary.reconstruct`: Rebuild damaged boundaries

### Field Operations
- `/field.audit`: Analyze field properties
- `/field.partition`: Divide field into regions
- `/field.snapshot`: Capture field state
- `/field.evolution`: Guide field development

### Agency Operations
- `/agency.activate`: Enable autonomous action
- `/agency.self-prompt`: Generate recursive prompts
- `/agency.evolve`: Improve agency capabilities
- `/agency.initiate`: Begin autonomous processes

## Using Field Protocols

Field protocols can be used in several ways:

### 1. As Conceptual Frameworks

Use protocol definitions as conceptual frameworks for understanding field dynamics, even without implementation:

```python
# Conceptual use of attractor.co.emerge principles
def conceptual_co_emergence(concept_a, concept_b):
    """Generate insights through conceptual co-emergence."""
    # Identify key patterns in each concept
    patterns_a = identify_patterns(concept_a)
    patterns_b = identify_patterns(concept_b)
    
    # Look for potential connections
    connections = find_connections(patterns_a, patterns_b)
    
    # Generate insights from connections
    insights = generate_insights(connections)
    
    return insights
```

### 2. As Implementation Templates

Implement protocols directly in code:

```python
from context_engineering import Field, Protocol

# Create field
field = Field()

# Initialize protocol
protocol = Protocol.from_shell("attractor.co.emerge.shell")

# Prepare input
input_data = {
    "current_field_state": field,
    "candidate_attractors": detect_attractors(field)
}

# Execute protocol
result = protocol.execute(input_data)

# Use results
updated_field = result["updated_field_state"]
co_emergent_attractors = result["co_emergent_attractors"]
```

### 3. As Integration Points

Use protocols as integration points between different context engineering approaches:

```python
def integrated_context_approach(input_text):
    # Parse input into field
    field = create_field_from_text(input_text)
    
    # Apply co-emergence protocol
    co_emergence_result = protocols["attractor.co.emerge"].execute({
        "current_field_state": field
    })
    
    # Apply recursive emergence protocol
    recursive_result = protocols["recursive.emergence"].execute({
        "initial_field_state": co_emergence_result["updated_field_state"]
    })
    
    # Generate response from evolved field
    response = generate_response(recursive_result["updated_field_state"])
    
    return response
```

## Protocol Schema Validation

Protocol schemas provide formal definitions for validating protocol shells:

```python
import json
from jsonschema import validate

# Load protocol shell
with open("shells/attractor.co.emerge.shell", "r") as f:
    protocol_shell = f.read()

# Parse shell into JSON
protocol_json = parse_shell_to_json(protocol_shell)

# Load schema
with open("schemas/protocolShell.v1.json", "r") as f:
    schema = json.load(f)

# Validate protocol against schema
validate(instance=protocol_json, schema=schema)
```

## Creating New Protocols

To create a new protocol shell:

1. **Identify Purpose**: Define the specific field operations you want to encapsulate
2. **Define Structure**: Create the shell structure following the Pareto-lang format
3. **Specify Operations**: Define the specific operations in the process section
4. **Document Thoroughly**: Create detailed documentation explaining the protocol
5. **Validate**: Ensure your protocol conforms to the schema
6. **Test**: Implement and test the protocol in various scenarios
7. **Create Digest**: Provide a simplified explanation in the digests directory

## Protocol Composition

Protocols can be composed to create more complex operations:

```python
def compose_protocols(field, protocol_sequence):
    """
    Execute a sequence of protocols on a field.
    
    Args:
        field: Initial semantic field
        protocol_sequence: List of protocol names to execute in sequence
        
    Returns:
        Result of the final protocol execution
    """
    current_field = field
    results = []
    
    for protocol_name in protocol_sequence:
        if protocol_name not in protocols:
            raise ValueError(f"Protocol {protocol_name} not found")
        
        # Execute protocol with current field
        result = protocols[protocol_name].execute({
            "initial_field_state": current_field
        })
        
        # Update current field for next protocol
        current_field = result["updated_field_state"]
        results.append(result)
    
    return current_field, results
```
