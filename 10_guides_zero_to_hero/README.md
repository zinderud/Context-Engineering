# Context Engineering: Zero to Hero Guides


> *"The limits of my language mean the limits of my world."* — Ludwig Wittgenstein
> 
> Context Engineering expands these limits, creating new possibilities for human-AI collaboration.


This directory contains hands-on, practical guides to help you progress from basic context engineering concepts to advanced techniques. Each guide builds on the previous one, creating a comprehensive learning path from fundamentals to cutting-edge applications.

##  How to Use These Guides

Each guide is designed to be:
- **Self-contained** — You can run each file independently
- **Progressive** — Concepts build on previous guides
- **Practical** — Every concept includes runnable code examples
- **Measurable** — Each technique includes metrics to evaluate its effectiveness

##  Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/davidkimai/Context-Engineering.git
   cd Context-Engineering/10_guides_zero_to_hero
   ```

2. **Set up your environment**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the first guide**
   ```
   python 01_min_prompt.py
   ```
   
   Or in a Jupyter notebook:
   ```
   %run 01_min_prompt.py
   ```

##  Learning Path

The guides follow a deliberate progression from basic to advanced concepts:

###  Foundations (1-3)
- **[01_min_prompt.py](01_min_prompt.py)**: Understand the fundamentals of atomic prompts and measure their effectiveness
- **[02_expand_context.py](02_expand_context.py)**: Learn techniques for expanding context with examples, role definitions, and constraints
- **[03_control_loops.py](03_control_loops.py)**: Master iterative feedback systems and multi-step LLM interactions

###  Advanced Implementations (4-7)
- **[04_rag_recipes.py](04_rag_recipes.py)**: Implement retrieval-augmented generation for knowledge-grounded responses
- **[05_prompt_programs.py](05_prompt_programs.py)**: Create structured reasoning systems using prompt programs
- **[06_schema_design.py](06_schema_design.py)**: Design schemas for consistent, verifiable, and composable contexts
- **[07_recursive_patterns.py](07_recursive_patterns.py)**: Explore self-improving contexts with recursive patterns

###  Frontier Concepts (8+)
- **Field Protocols** (Guides 8-10): Master field theories, emergence, residue, and attractor dynamics
- **Meta-Systems** (Guides 11-15): Explore quantum semantics, self-improvement, transparency, and cross-modal integration

##  Key Concepts Covered

Each guide demonstrates key Context Engineering principles with practical examples:

| Guide | Key Concepts | Practical Applications |
|-------|-------------|------------------------|
| 01_min_prompt | Token budgeting, atomic instructions, ROI measurement | Minimal viable prompts, efficiency optimization |
| 02_expand_context | Few-shot examples, role definition, constraints | Templated contexts, systematic expansion |
| 03_control_loops | Sequential chaining, iterative refinement, conditional branching | Multi-step workflows, self-verification |
| 04_rag_recipes | Retrieval, chunking, context integration | Knowledge-grounded responses, factuality |
| 05_prompt_programs | Structured reasoning, verification protocols, compositional operations | Complex reasoning, explanatory systems |
| 06_schema_design | JSON schemas, validation, structure enforcement | Consistent outputs, structured data extraction |
| 07_recursive_patterns | Self-reflection, bootstrapping, symbolic residue | Evolving systems, meta-reasoning |

##  What to Expect from Each Guide

Every guide follows a consistent structure:

1. **Conceptual Introduction** — Explaining the "why" behind each technique
2. **Implementation Examples** — Working code demonstrating the concepts
3. **Evaluation Methods** — How to measure the effectiveness of each approach
4. **Visualization Tools** — Ways to visualize and understand what's happening
5. **Extension Exercises** — Suggested ways to build on what you've learned

##  Experimental Approach

Context Engineering is best learned through experimentation. For each guide:

1. **Run the examples** as provided
2. **Modify parameters** to see how they affect the outcomes
3. **Measure the impact** using the provided metrics
4. **Combine techniques** from different guides to create hybrid approaches
5. **Experiment with your own use cases** to see how these principles apply

##  Evaluation and Metrics

Every technique is accompanied by metrics to evaluate its effectiveness:

- **Token Efficiency** — Output value vs. token cost
- **Response Quality** — How well outputs match intentions
- **Latency Impact** — Processing time for different approaches
- **Consistency** — How reliable the results are across runs
- **Emergent Properties** — What unexpected behaviors arise

##  Contribution Guidelines

This directory is actively expanding. If you'd like to contribute:

1. Follow the established pattern for new guides
2. Ensure each guide builds on previous concepts
3. Include practical, runnable examples
4. Provide metrics for evaluation
5. Submit a PR with a clear description of what your guide teaches

##  Future Additions

We plan to expand these guides with:
- Multi-modal context techniques
- Large-scale system orchestration
- Specialized domain applications
- Infrastructure and scaling patterns
- User experience design for context systems
