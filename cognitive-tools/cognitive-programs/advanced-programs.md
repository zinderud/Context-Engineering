## Advanced Programming Patterns

### 1. Higher-Order Functions

Higher-order functions take other functions as inputs or return them as outputs, enabling powerful abstractions and composability.

```javascript
function applyReasoningStrategy(problem, strategy, options = {}) {
  // Higher-order function that applies different reasoning strategies
  
  // Strategy functions that can be passed in
  const strategies = {
    decomposition: function(p) {
      return `
        Task: Solve this problem by breaking it into smaller sub-problems.
        
        Problem: ${p}
        
        Process:
        1. Identify the main components of the problem
        2. Break the problem into distinct sub-problems
        3. Solve each sub-problem individually
        4. Integrate the solutions to solve the complete problem
        
        Start by clearly stating each sub-problem before solving it.
      `;
    },
    
    analogy: function(p) {
      return `
        Task: Solve this problem by finding an analogous simpler problem.
        
        Problem: ${p}
        
        Process:
        1. Identify the underlying structure of the problem
        2. Recall a similar problem with a known solution
        3. Map the elements from the known problem to this problem
        4. Adapt the known solution to fit this problem
        
        Start by explicitly stating the analogy you're using.
      `;
    },
    
    firstPrinciples: function(p) {
      return `
        Task: Solve this problem using first principles reasoning.
        
        Problem: ${p}
        
        Process:
        1. Identify the fundamental truths or principles relevant to this problem
        2. Break down the problem to these essential elements
        3. Build a solution from the ground up
        4. Verify the solution using these principles
        
        Start by clearly stating the fundamental principles you're using.
      `;
    }
  };
  
  // If strategy is a string, use one of the predefined strategies
  if (typeof strategy === 'string') {
    if (!strategies[strategy]) {
      throw new Error(`Unknown strategy: ${strategy}`);
    }
    return strategies[strategy](problem);
  }
  
  // If strategy is a function, apply it directly
  if (typeof strategy === 'function') {
    return strategy(problem, options);
  }
  
  throw new Error('Strategy must be a string or function');
}

// Custom strategy function
function socraticMethod(problem, options = {}) {
  const questions = options.questions || [
    "What are the key concepts involved?",
    "What assumptions are we making?",
    "What would happen if those assumptions were different?",
    "Can we break this down into simpler questions?",
    "What analogous problems have we solved before?"
  ];
  
  return `
    Task: Explore this problem using the Socratic method.
    
    Problem: ${problem}
    
    Process:
    Ask and answer a series of probing questions:
    ${questions.map((q, i) => `${i+1}. ${q}`).join('\n')}
    
    For each question, provide a thoughtful answer before moving to the next question.
    After exploring all questions, synthesize your insights to solve the original problem.
  `;
}

// Usage examples
const decompositionPrompt = applyReasoningStrategy(
  "How might climate change affect global agriculture by 2050?",
  "decomposition"
);

const socraticPrompt = applyReasoningStrategy(
  "Is artificial intelligence more likely to help or harm humanity?",
  socraticMethod,
  { questions: [
    "What do we mean by 'help' and 'harm'?",
    "What assumptions are we making about AI development?",
    "What historical analogies might be relevant?",
    "What are the key risks and benefits to consider?",
    "How might different stakeholders be affected differently?"
  ]}
);
```

### 2. Decorator Pattern

Decorators modify the behavior of functions without changing their core implementation, enabling layered enhancements.

```javascript
function withExampleGeneration(reasoningFunction) {
  // Decorator that adds example generation to any reasoning function
  return function(problem, options = {}) {
    const basePrompt = reasoningFunction(problem, options);
    
    // Add example generation
    return `
      ${basePrompt}
      
      After you've developed your solution, generate 2-3 specific examples that test your solution.
      For each example:
      1. Create a concrete instance of the problem
      2. Apply your solution approach step by step
      3. Verify the result is correct
      
      These examples will help validate your solution and demonstrate its application.
    `;
  };
}

function withAlternativePerspectives(reasoningFunction) {
  // Decorator that adds consideration of alternative perspectives
  return function(problem, options = {}) {
    const basePrompt = reasoningFunction(problem, options);
    
    // Add perspective consideration
    return `
      ${basePrompt}
      
      After developing your initial solution, consider at least two alternative perspectives or approaches:
      
      Alternative Perspective 1:
      - How would someone with a different background approach this?
      - What different assumptions might they make?
      - What insights does this perspective offer?
      
      Alternative Perspective 2:
      - How would a different discipline or field approach this?
      - What frameworks or methods would they apply?
      - What insights does this perspective offer?
      
      After exploring these alternatives, refine your original solution by incorporating valuable insights.
    `;
  };
}

// Usage examples
const standardSolver = step_by_step_reasoning;
const solverWithExamples = withExampleGeneration(step_by_step_reasoning);
const comprehensiveSolver = withAlternativePerspectives(withExampleGeneration(step_by_step_reasoning));

const prompt1 = standardSolver("Solve for x: 3x + 7 = 22");
const prompt2 = solverWithExamples("Solve for x: 3x + 7 = 22");
const prompt3 = comprehensiveSolver("How might rising interest rates affect housing markets?");
```

### 3. Self-Improving Programs

These programs incorporate feedback loops that enable them to refine their own outputs.

```javascript
function selfImprovingReasoner(problem, iterations = 2, options = {}) {
  // Base prompt for initial solution
  const initialPrompt = `
    Task: Solve the following problem.
    
    Problem: ${problem}
    
    Instructions:
    1. Carefully read and understand the problem
    2. Plan your approach to solving it
    3. Execute your plan step by step
    4. Verify your solution
    
    Provide your complete solution below.
  `;
  
  // Improvement prompt template
  const improvementTemplate = (solution, iteration) => `
    Task: Improve the following solution to the problem.
    
    Problem: ${problem}
    
    Current Solution (Iteration ${iteration}):
    ${solution}
    
    Instructions for Improvement:
    1. Critically evaluate the current solution
    2. Identify specific weaknesses, gaps, or errors
    3. Consider how to address each issue
    4. Provide an improved solution that fixes these issues
    
    Focus on these aspects:
    ${iteration === 1 ? 
      "- Correctness: Is the solution mathematically/logically sound?\n- Completeness: Does it address all aspects of the problem?" :
      "- Clarity: Is the explanation clear and easy to follow?\n- Efficiency: Is there a more elegant or efficient approach?"}
    
    Provide your improved solution below.
  `;
  
  // Construct the complete self-improving prompt
  let fullPrompt = initialPrompt;
  
  for (let i = 1; i <= iterations; i++) {
    fullPrompt += `
    
    --- AFTER COMPLETING YOUR SOLUTION ABOVE ---
    
    ${improvementTemplate("[Your solution from above]", i)}
    `;
  }
  
  return fullPrompt;
}

// Usage
const basicPrompt = selfImprovingReasoner(
  "Design a system to reduce traffic congestion in urban areas",
  2
);

// More complex example with customization
function customSelfImprovingReasoner(problem, evaluationCriteria, iterations = 2) {
  // Initial solution prompt
  const initialPrompt = step_by_step_reasoning(problem);
  
  // Generate improvement phases
  let improvementPhases = "";
  
  for (let i = 1; i <= iterations; i++) {
    const criteriaForThisIteration = evaluationCriteria[Math.min(i-1, evaluationCriteria.length-1)];
    
    improvementPhases += `
    
    --- IMPROVEMENT PHASE ${i} ---
    
    Review your solution above according to these criteria:
    ${criteriaForThisIteration.map(c => `- ${c}`).join('\n')}
    
    For each criterion:
    1. Evaluate how well your current solution meets this criterion
    2. Identify specific ways to improve
    3. Revise your solution accordingly
    
    Provide your improved solution below.
    `;
  }
  
  return initialPrompt + improvementPhases;
}

// Example usage with custom criteria
const evaluationCriteria = [
  ["Logical soundness", "Comprehensiveness", "Evidence-based reasoning"],
  ["Clarity of explanation", "Practical feasibility", "Consideration of trade-offs"],
  ["Originality", "Ethical considerations", "Long-term implications"]
];

const customImprovedPrompt = customSelfImprovingReasoner(
  "How could genetic engineering technology be regulated to maximize benefits while minimizing risks?",
  evaluationCriteria,
  3
);
```

### 4. Meta-Programming

Meta-programming involves programs that generate or modify other programs, enabling dynamic customization.

```javascript
function generateSpecializedReasoner(domain, complexity = "intermediate") {
  // This function generates a domain-specific reasoning program
  
  // Domain-specific knowledge and approaches
  const domainKnowledge = {
    mathematics: {
      concepts: ["equations", "functions", "geometry", "calculus", "probability"],
      approaches: ["algebraic manipulation", "geometric visualization", "numerical approximation"],
      common_mistakes: ["sign errors", "incorrect application of formulas", "calculation errors"],

    },

      verification: ["consider counter-examples", "test with edge cases", "examine assumptions"]
    },
    
    business: {
      concepts: ["market analysis", "competitive advantage", "financial metrics", "strategy", "operations"],
      approaches: ["cost-benefit analysis", "SWOT analysis", "stakeholder mapping", "scenario planning"],
      common_mistakes: ["sunk cost fallacy", "confirmation bias", "short-term thinking"],
      verification: ["financial validation", "market testing", "sensitivity analysis"]
    }
  };
  
  // Complexity levels
  const complexityLevels = {
    basic: {
      steps: 3,
      depth: "Focus on fundamental concepts and straightforward applications.",
      guidance: "Provide clear, step-by-step instructions with explanations of each step."
    },
    
    intermediate: {
      steps: 5,
      depth: "Incorporate domain-specific techniques and address common complications.",
      guidance: "Balance guidance with opportunities for independent reasoning."
    },
    
    advanced: {
      steps: 7,
      depth: "Address nuanced considerations, edge cases, and theoretical implications.",
      guidance: "Provide high-level guidance while encouraging sophisticated analysis."
    }
  };
  
  // Check if domain is supported
  if (!domainKnowledge[domain]) {
    throw new Error(`Domain not supported: ${domain}. Supported domains: ${Object.keys(domainKnowledge).join(", ")}`);
  }
  
  // Check if complexity is supported
  if (!complexityLevels[complexity]) {
    throw new Error(`Complexity level not supported: ${complexity}. Supported levels: ${Object.keys(complexityLevels).join(", ")}`);
  }
  
  const domainInfo = domainKnowledge[domain];
  const complexityInfo = complexityLevels[complexity];
  
  // Generate the domain-specific reasoning function
  return function(problem, options = {}) {
    // Construct domain-specific steps
    let steps = [];
    
    // Common first step for all domains
    steps.push(`Understand the ${domain} problem: Identify key elements and goals.`);
    
    // Domain-specific steps
    if (domain === "mathematics") {
      steps.push("Identify relevant mathematical concepts and formulas.");
      steps.push("Set up the mathematical representation of the problem.");
      if (complexity !== "basic") {
        steps.push("Consider different solution approaches and select the most appropriate one.");
      }
      steps.push("Execute the solution step-by-step, showing all work.");
      if (complexity === "advanced") {
        steps.push("Consider edge cases and special conditions.");
        steps.push("Explore alternative solutions or optimizations.");
      }
    } 
    else if (domain === "ethics") {
      steps.push("Identify the ethical dimensions and stakeholders involved.");
      steps.push("Analyze the problem from multiple ethical frameworks.");
      if (complexity !== "basic") {
        steps.push("Consider conflicting values and principles at play.");
      }
      steps.push("Develop reasoned ethical judgments or recommendations.");
      if (complexity === "advanced") {
        steps.push("Address potential objections and counterarguments.");
        steps.push("Explore broader implications and precedents.");
      }
    }
    else if (domain === "business") {
      steps.push("Analyze the business context and relevant market factors.");
      steps.push("Identify key business objectives and constraints.");
      if (complexity !== "basic") {
        steps.push("Evaluate multiple strategic options or approaches.");
      }
      steps.push("Develop recommendations with supporting rationale.");
      if (complexity === "advanced") {
        steps.push("Consider implementation challenges and risk mitigation.");
        steps.push("Evaluate long-term implications and sustainability.");
      }
    }
    
    // Common final step for all domains
    steps.push(`Verify your solution: Check for errors and ensure it addresses the original ${domain} problem.`);
    
    // Construct the domain-specific prompt
    return `
      Task: Solve the following ${domain} problem at a ${complexity} level.
      
      Problem: ${problem}

      ${complexityInfo.depth}
      
      Conclude with a clear, well-justified solution to the original problem.
    `;
  };
}

// Usage examples
const mathReasoner = generateSpecializedReasoner("mathematics", "intermediate");
const ethicsReasoner = generateSpecializedReasoner("ethics", "advanced");
const businessReasoner = generateSpecializedReasoner("business", "basic");

const mathPrompt = mathReasoner("Solve for x in the equation 3x² + 7x - 22 = 0");
const ethicsPrompt = ethicsReasoner("Is it ethical for companies to collect and sell user data?");
const businessPrompt = businessReasoner("How should a retail store respond to increasing online competition?");
```

### 5. Dynamic Programming Execution

This pattern involves generating and executing code dynamically, enabling computational reasoning that goes beyond static prompts.

```javascript
function dynamicComputationalReasoning(problem, computationalApproach = "numerical") {
  // Approaches to computational reasoning
  const approaches = {
    numerical: {
      description: "Using numerical computations to solve problems with concrete values",
      codeTemplate: `
        function solve(input) {
          // Convert the problem into numerical calculations
          // Parse any relevant numbers from the input
          const parsedValues = extractNumbers(input);
          
          // Set up computations
          // [Code to solve the problem numerically]
          
          // Return the result
          return result;
        }
        
        function extractNumbers(text) {
          // Extract numerical values from text
          const numbers = text.match(/\\d+(\\.\\d+)?/g) || [];
          return numbers.map(n => parseFloat(n));
        }
      `
    },
    
    symbolic: {
      description: "Using symbolic mathematics to solve problems with variables and equations",
      codeTemplate: `
        function solve(input) {
          // Set up symbolic variables and equations
          // [Code to parse and represent algebraic expressions]
          
          // Solve the equations symbolically
          // [Code to manipulate and solve equations]
          
          // Return the symbolic solution
          return solution;
        }
      `
    },
    
    probabilistic: {
      description: "Using probability and statistics to reason about uncertain outcomes",
      codeTemplate: `
        function solve(input) {
          // Set up probability distributions and parameters
          // [Code to define probability models]
          
          // Compute probabilities or statistical measures
          // [Code to calculate probabilistic outcomes]
          
          // Return the probabilistic analysis
          return analysis;
        }
      `
    },
    
    algorithmic: {
      description: "Using algorithms to solve computational problems step by step",
      codeTemplate: `
        function solve(input) {
          // Define the algorithm steps
          // [Code to implement the algorithm]
          
          // Execute the algorithm
          // [Code to run the algorithm on the input]
          
          // Return the result
          return result;
        }
      `
    }
  };
  
  // Check if approach is supported
  if (!approaches[computationalApproach]) {
    throw new Error(`Approach not supported: ${computationalApproach}. Supported approaches: ${Object.keys(approaches).join(", ")}`);
  }
  
  const approach = approaches[computationalApproach];
  
  // Construct the computational reasoning prompt
  return `
    Task: Solve the following problem using ${computationalApproach} computational reasoning.
    
    Problem: ${problem}
    
    Instructions:
    Approach this problem computationally using ${approach.description}.
    
    1. First, translate the problem into a computational representation.
    2. Then, develop code to solve the problem.
    3. Trace through the execution of your code step by step.
    4. Interpret the computational results in the context of the original problem.
    
    You may use the following code template as a starting point:
    
    \`\`\`javascript
    ${approach.codeTemplate}
    \`\`\`
    
    Modify this template as needed to solve the specific problem.
    
    After writing your code, trace through its execution with the given input, showing intermediate values and results.
    
    Finally, interpret the computational results in plain language to directly answer the original problem.
  `;
}

// Usage examples
const numericalPrompt = dynamicComputationalReasoning(
  "If a car travels at 60 mph for 2.5 hours, how far does it go?",
  "numerical"
);

const symbolicPrompt = dynamicComputationalReasoning(
  "Find the general solution to the differential equation dy/dx = 2x + y",
  "symbolic"
);

const probabilisticPrompt = dynamicComputationalReasoning(
  "If a fair coin is flipped 10 times, what is the probability of getting exactly 7 heads?",
  "probabilistic"
);

const algorithmicPrompt = dynamicComputationalReasoning(
  "Find the shortest path between nodes A and F in the given graph",
  "algorithmic"
);
```

### 6. Dynamic Protocol Generation

This pattern generates structured interaction protocols dynamically based on task requirements.

```javascript
function generateTaskProtocol(task, participantRoles, options = {}) {
  // Default options
  const defaults = {
    interactionSteps: 4,
    outputFormat: "structured",  // Can be "structured", "narrative", "hybrid"
    qualityChecks: true,
    adaptationRules: true
  };
  
  // Merge defaults with provided options
  const settings = {...defaults, ...options};
  
  // Ensure participantRoles is an array
  const roles = Array.isArray(participantRoles) ? participantRoles : [participantRoles];
  
  // Generic interaction protocol steps
  const protocolSteps = [
    {
      name: "Task Analysis",
      description: "Analyze and break down the task into components",
      roleActions: roles.reduce((actions, role) => {
        actions[role] = getAnalysisAction(role, task);
        return actions;
      }, {})
    },
    {
      name: "Information Gathering",
      description: "Collect relevant information and resources",
      roleActions: roles.reduce((actions, role) => {
        actions[role] = getInformationAction(role, task);
        return actions;
      }, {})
    },
    {
      name: "Solution Development",
      description: "Develop potential solutions or approaches",
      roleActions: roles.reduce((actions, role) => {
        actions[role] = getSolutionAction(role, task);
        return actions;
      }, {})
    },
    {
      name: "Evaluation and Refinement",
      description: "Evaluate solutions and refine as needed",
      roleActions: roles.reduce((actions, role) => {
        actions[role] = getEvaluationAction(role, task);
        return actions;
      }, {})
    },
    {
      name: "Implementation Planning",
      description: "Plan the implementation of the chosen solution",
      roleActions: roles.reduce((actions, role) => {
        actions[role] = getImplementationAction(role, task);
        return actions;
      }, {})
    },
    {
      name: "Final Synthesis",
      description: "Synthesize findings and finalize the output",
      roleActions: roles.reduce((actions, role) => {
        actions[role] = getSynthesisAction(role, task);
        return actions;
      }, {})
    }
  ];
  
  // Select the appropriate number of steps based on settings

## Advanced Cognitive System Architectures

Building on these programming patterns, we can create sophisticated cognitive system architectures.

### 1. Hierarchical Problem-Solving System

This architecture combines multiple cognitive programs in a hierarchical structure for tackling complex problems.

function hierarchicalProblemSolver(problem, options = {}) {
  // Default options
  const defaults = {
    maxDepth: 3,
    verificationEnabled: true,
    reflectionEnabled: true,
    adaptiveStrategy: true
  };
  
  // Merge defaults with provided options
  const settings = {...defaults, ...options};
  
  // Top-level system prompt
  const systemPrompt = `
    Task: Solve the following complex problem using a hierarchical approach.
    
    Problem: ${problem}

      ADAPTIVE STRATEGY RULES:
      
      Throughout the problem-solving process, apply these adaptive rules:
      
      1. If a sub-problem proves more complex than anticipated:
         - Further decompose it into smaller sub-problems
         - Adjust the hierarchical structure accordingly
         - Allocate additional attention to this branch
      
      2. If integration reveals conflicts between sub-solutions:
         - Identify the source of the conflict
         - Revisit the relevant sub-problems with additional constraints
         - Develop a resolution approach at the Executive Level
      
      3. If verification reveals issues with the complete solution:
         - Trace the issue to the appropriate level
         - Apply targeted corrections rather than starting over
         - Re-verify the solution after corrections
      
      4. If new information or insights emerge during the process:
         - Evaluate their impact on the current approach
         - Incorporate relevant information at the appropriate level
         - Adjust the strategy if necessary
      
      These rules allow the system to adapt dynamically to challenges encountered during problem-solving.
